- Log into the AWS console using the details provided on your Credential Note

- Set the region to Sydney (stay in this region today, check from time to time)

- Navigate to EC2


- Click Launch Instance

- Step 1: Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- Select "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base"

- Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
- Select "t2.micro"
- Select Review and Launch

- Launch

- Popup: "Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair"
- Select: "Create a new key pair"

- Provide: Type a name, then "Download Key Pair" and keep it safe, we will use this a couple of times today.

- Select: "Launch instances"

- Scroll down and select "View Instances"

- Review the "Instances" page.
- Review the "Description" tab for the running instance.

- Set the name of the instance, by clicking the pencil in the name column.  Set the name to "my-ec2-instance".

- Look at the "Tags" tab, notice that the name is set as a tag.

- Wait for the "Status Checks" 2/2.  This means that the host and guest OS's are passing status checks.

- Letâ€™s check that the Windows server is up and running:

- With the instance selected, select "Actions", "Instance Settings", "Get System Log"

- You should be able to see system logs sent from the server.

- Notice the Password field is encrypted
- Is there a line that says: "Message: Windows is Ready to use"?

- With the instance selected, select "Actions", "Instance Settings", "Get Instance Screenshot"

- You should see an image of the screen output of the server. 

- You can't interact with this image, so lets login to the server.

- Lets decrypt the Windows Administrator password:

- With the instance selected, select "Actions", "Get Windows Password"
- Browse to the key file you downloaded earlier in this section.

- Select "Decrypt Password"

- Keep the details safe somewhere.  This is the only place you will find the password.

- Again with the instance selected, click "Actions" and select "connect"

- Popup: "Connect To Your Instance" select "Download Remote Desktop File"

- This should download, automatically open, and configure a Remote Desktop Protocol client to connect to your instance.

- If clicking the "Download Remote Desktop File" didn't work for you:
- Open your RDP client, enter the DNS value into the address field
- When prompted enter the username and password.

- Note: when you connect you may be prompted by security warnings.  This is not a production environment, these warnings are ok.

- Now let's clean up.  We don't need this server anymore:

- With the instance selected, select "Actions", "Instance State", "Terminate"

- Review the warning to make sure you are terminating the right instance, if so, select "Yes, Terminate"

- Note the Key is still in the account (along with some other stuff :( ), but that's ok we will use it later.


- Return to the "EC2 Dashboard", you should have 0 (Zero) running instances.
